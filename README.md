# Roast My Music Taste 🎧🔥

A small Python app that connects to Spotify’s Web API to detect what you’re currently listening to, then uses Google’s Gemini API to generate a funny, snarky, and slightly judgy comment about your music taste.

Built as a lightweight experiment combining third-party APIs, prompt design, and a simple web deployment.

## How It Works

2. Sends the song metadata (track, artist, context) to the Gemini API  
3. Returns a playful roast based on your listening choice

- Integrating multiple external APIs  
- Shipping a small idea end-to-end, from concept to deployment
